Do you like to read?

DO YOU WANT TO READ TEXTS TO LEARN ENGLISH?  Learning English by reading is more fun than you might think You no longer have to limit yourself to following along with the textbook in monotonous classes where the numbers on the clock are the only thing you want to read, just waiting for the time when you can go home

The internet has changed our ways of accessing knowledge as well as information and art Before, you would have had to go to a library, bookstore, magazine stand, or something similar You wouldnt find as many titles as you find online and youd normally have to pay for them or borrow them for a few days Nowadays, youre lucky You just need Google to find thousands of ways to read about your favorite subjects You can choose as many as you want and even keep a library of 2,000 books on your smartphone

With so many alternatives, choosing can be difficult Dont know where to start? ABA English can guide you Our texts are organized by level so that you can learn with the right materials

Choose based on your interests
If you like graphic novels, comics, or manga, dont be afraid Perhaps as you increase your level youll have to shift to more complex texts in English to learn, but the important thing is that you read something that motivates you to do so frequently Even searching for English versions of your favorite books can be very helpful since you can infer the meanings of some words by context

Build your vocabulary
One of the main advantages of reading is discovering new words Dont neglect this It would be best to discover their meanings from context, but if you cant, write them down and when you finish your reading, you can look them up in the dictionary For best results use an English dictionary, not a bilingual dictionary

Dont overdo it
Reading a more advanced book can be challenging and exciting You may think youll be able to progress faster, but this can be counterproductive Reading and understanding even a small part of this might be overwhelming and could destroy your willingness to read and learn

Share your learning experience
Hobbies are more enjoyable if you have someone to comment and discuss them with Book clubs might not be very common, but youll find it much more motivating if you can convince a friend to read texts to learn English with you and then share your perspectives
